# ESP8266-WEB-SERVER
A standalone IoT web application hosted directly on the ESP8266, designed to remotely control an LED (or relay-driven appliance) through a modern, browser-based user interface. The ESP8266 operates as a self-contained HTTP server, eliminating the need for external cloud services while providing real-time hardware control over Wi-Fi.

Use the code_for_webserver in arduino IDE where you need have preinstalled ESP-8266 board from boardmanager and then upload this on ESP-8266

Project Overview
This project demonstrates how embedded systems can directly host modern web interfaces while maintaining efficient memory usage and reliable real-time performance. It showcases the seamless integration of hardware control, networking, and front-end design within a single low-cost microcontroller.
